                        In the distant past, the Archons granted mortals unique elemental abilities. With the help of such powers, people formed a bountiful homeland out of the wilderness. However, 300 years ago, the collapse of an ancient civilization turned the universe upside down...</p>

                    <p>Neyvat is a world where gods live side by side with humans. The seven gods called Archons in this game become the rulers of the seven great lands of Neyvat. Each country has its own elements and culture symbols. The balance of Neyvat depends on each Archon's leadership of his country.</p>

                                <h1>Shifu Inn</h1>
                                <p>
                                    A landmark within Apriel Marsh, built upon a massive stone pillar.
                                    <br>                                   
                                    As most of the patrons that stop here are traveling merchants, the inn provides an area for them to trade and set up stalls. The view 
                                    from the top of the inn is jaw-dropping — weather permitting you can see all the way to Mt. Quanzhong and Jiling Karst in the distance.
                                    <br>
                                    Legend amongst the stalls says that the tower of the inn hides a mysterious secret, but that's as far as the legend goes, as no-one 
                                    has ever been able to validify the claims.

                                    forests sits Quanzhong Village.

                                    White rolling clouds that sit in the valleys between the mountains are embellished with

                                    <br>
                                    Sapporo is under the jurisdiction of the Kanjou Commission and people need various documents to be granted passage. However, to get 
                                    the necessary Travel Permit, you have to go through a very complicated procedure and have the right connections.
