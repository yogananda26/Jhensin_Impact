              Jenshin Impekz is an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. It was released for Microsoft Windows, iOS, and Android in 2020, and is set for release on Nintendo Switch soon. The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics through which players can obtain new characters and weapons. The base game is expanded on a regular basis through patches using the games as a service model.

              Jenshin Impekz is an open-world action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party. Switching between characters can be done quickly during combat. Characters may have their strengths enhanced in various ways, such as increasing a character's level and improving artifacts and the weapons that the character equips. In addition to exploration, the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Completing these challenges grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and raises the World Level.

              Development of Jenshin Impekz began in 2017. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's combat mechanics and immersive open world, but criticizing its simplistic endgame and monetization model. It had a first-year launch revenue of more than $10 billion in its first year of release, the highest for any video game, and a revenue of more than $7 billion as of March 2022. Prior to its release the game had over 10 million registrations. According to some, the game was the biggest international release of any Chinese video game.

              Jenshin Impekz takes place in the world of Teyvat, and is composed of the seven major. Each nation is ruled by a different god. The mysterious floating island of Celestia is allegedly home to gods and mortals who have ascended to godhood through great, heroic feats. Underground lie the ruins of the nation of Khaenri'ah which was destroyed by gods. Unlike the seven nations, Khaenri'ah was not ruled over by a god. The Traveler is separated from their twin and becomes trapped in Teyvat. They are joined by a companion, Paimon, as they journey through Teyvat in search of their lost sibling.
